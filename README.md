# About me
I am an optimistic individual with two sides that reflect my power. On the one hand, my experience as a QA engineerÂ has made me organised, careful, and detail-oriented. On the other hand, because of my personality, I enjoy interacting with others and discover solutions to issues.

I got my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from Kantipur Engineering College affiliated to Tribhuvan University, Nepal for 4 years. I gained useful technical knowledge and real-world experience from the demanding coursework and practical projects, which equipped me to succeed in the fast-paced field of computer engineering.

Over the past three years, I have worked as a software tester, gaining a profound understanding of the quality assurance (QA) process and the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC). I am well-versed in all stages of the STLC, from requirement analysis to test closure. My extensive experience with industry-standard QA procedures encompasses meticulous test planning, execution, defect tracking, and reporting. I specialize in various testing methodologies, including regression testing, smoke testing, sanity testing, monkey testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

In order to fulfil my two-year goal of becoming a senior software tester, I am actively seeking a role that offers both challenges and motivation.

# Skills

Examples of the skills mentioned are provided in the Examples of my Work section.

## Manual Testing
* **Understanding Requirements:** I start by thoroughly understanding the requirements and specifications of the application. This helps in identifying the scope and objectives of testing.

* **Creating Test Plans:** Based on the requirements, I create detailed test plans. These include the testing strategy, objectives, resources, schedule, and deliverables.

* **Designing Test Cases:** I design comprehensive test cases that cover various scenarios, including positive, negative, boundary, and edge cases. Each test case outlines the title, pre condition, post condition(if any), description, steps to be executed, expected results, actual results and the test result.

* **Setting Up Test Environment and Test Data:**
I ensure that the test environment and test data is set up correctly. This involves configuring the hardware and software to mimic the production environment as closely as possible.

* **Executing Test Cases:**
I execute the test cases, meticulously following the steps outlined and documenting the results. This helps in identifying any discrepancies between the expected and actual results.

* **Reporting Bugs:**
If any issues or bugs are found, I document them in detail. This includes the bug title, description, steps to reproduce the bug, the severity, screenshots, current behavior, expected behavior and any other relevant information. I use bug tracking tools e.g. Jira to log and manage these issues. Once the bug is reported I communicate with the team to assign it to the appropriate team member to solve it.

* **Re-Testing:**
After bugs are fixed, I re-test the bug fix and perform one round of regression testing to ensure that the fixes haven't introduced new issues and that the application still functions as expected.

* **Collaboration and Communication:**
I work closely with developers, QA team members, and other stakeholders to ensure clear communication regarding the testing process, findings, and any issues encountered.

* **Documentation:**
I maintain thorough documentation of all testing activities, including test cases, test results, bug reports, and test summaries. This ensures transparency and provides a record for future reference.
