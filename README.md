# About me
I am an optimistic individual with two sides that reflect my power. On the one hand, my experience as a QA engineerÂ has made me organised, careful, and detail-oriented. On the other hand, because of my personality, I enjoy interacting with others and discover solutions to issues.
I got my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from Kantipur Engineering College affiliated to Tribhuvan University, Nepal for 4 years. I gained useful technical knowledge and real-world experience from the demanding coursework and practical projects, which equipped me to succeed in the fast-paced field of computer engineering.
