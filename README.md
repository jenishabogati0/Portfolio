# About me
I am an optimistic individual with two sides that reflect my power. On the one hand, my experience as a QA engineerÂ has made me organised, careful, and detail-oriented. On the other hand, because of my personality, I enjoy interacting with others and discover solutions to issues.

I got my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from Kantipur Engineering College affiliated to Tribhuvan University, Nepal for 4 years. I gained useful technical knowledge and real-world experience from the demanding coursework and practical projects, which equipped me to succeed in the fast-paced field of computer engineering.

Over the past three years, I have worked as a software tester, gaining a profound understanding of the quality assurance (QA) process and the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC). I am well-versed in all stages of the STLC, from requirement analysis to test closure. My extensive experience with industry-standard QA procedures encompasses meticulous test planning, execution, defect tracking, and reporting. I specialize in various testing methodologies, including regression testing, smoke testing, sanity testing, monkey testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

In order to fulfil my two-year goal of becoming a senior software tester, I am actively seeking a role that offers both challenges and motivation.
